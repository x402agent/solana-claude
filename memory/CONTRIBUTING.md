# Contributing to Mnemosyne

Mnemosyne is a personal project that grew into something useful. If you're here, you're already part of the community. There are no gatekeepers — bug reports, documentation fixes, feature ideas, and code contributions are all welcome.

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AxDSan/mnemosyne.git
cd mnemosyne
pip install -e ".[all,dev]"
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

## What You Can Do

**No contribution is too small.**

- **Report bugs** — Open an issue with steps to reproduce. A clear bug report saves hours.
- **Improve docs** — Typos, unclear explanations, missing examples. If it confused you, fix it.
- **Share your use case** — Open a discussion. Real-world usage shapes the roadmap.
- **Submit code** — See below for guidelines.

## Code Contributions

### Versioning

Mnemosyne uses **Simple Versioning** (`MAJOR.MINOR`, no patch):

- **MINOR** bumps after every iteration: bug fixes, features, docs, refactors.
- **MAJOR** bumps only for significant new functionality (e.g., 1.0 → 2.0).

`__version__` in `mnemosyne/__init__.py` is the single source of truth. `pyproject.toml` reads from it automatically. If you open a PR that changes user-facing behavior, bump the version and add an entry to `CHANGELOG.md`.

### Releasing (maintainers only)

Releases are fully automated via GitHub Actions:

1. Bump `__version__` in `mnemosyne/__init__.py`
2. Commit and push to `main`
3. Tag and push:
   ```bash
   git tag -a v1.X.Y -m "Release v1.X.Y"
   git push origin v1.X.Y
   ```
4. The [release workflow](https://github.com/AxDSan/mnemosyne/actions/workflows/release.yml) handles the rest:
   - Builds wheel + sdist
   - Creates a [GitHub Release](https://github.com/AxDSan/mnemosyne/releases) with auto-generated notes
   - Publishes to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mnemosyne-memory/) via trusted publishing (OIDC)

No manual uploads. No API tokens.

### Principles

Mnemosyne is intentionally minimal. Every addition is weighed against these principles:

- **Local-first:** No cloud dependencies, no required API keys.
- **Minimal dependencies:** Prefer the Python stdlib. SQLite is the only database.
- **Zero-config:** Users should not need to edit config files to get basic functionality.
- **Fast:** Sub-millisecond reads and writes on standard hardware.

### Before You Code

1. **Open an issue first** for non-trivial changes. This prevents wasted effort.
2. **Keep it focused.** One PR per logical change.
3. **Add tests.** If you fix a bug or add a feature, include a test in `tests/`.
4. **Update the README** if user-facing behavior changes.
5. **Bump the version** in `mnemosyne/__init__.py` and update `CHANGELOG.md`.

### Review Process

There is no formal review board. Pull requests are reviewed by the maintainer and merged when they:

- Pass existing tests
- Follow the principles above
- Include a clear description of what changed and why

## Areas of Interest

These are not mandates — just directions where help would be valuable:

- Encrypted backup/sync (optional, user-controlled)
- Additional embedding model support
- Multi-language memory processing
- Better error messages and debugging tools
