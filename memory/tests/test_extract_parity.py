"""Regression tests for [C12.a]: Mnemosyne.remember(extract=True) writes
fact triples but skips the `facts` table. The canonical helper
_extract_and_store_facts in beam.py writes BOTH tables; the wrapper's
inline extract block only wrote triples. As a result, wrapper-extracted
facts were visible through recall() (which scores fact triples) but
invisible through fact_recall() (which queries the facts table directly).

Bug: mnemosyne/core/memory.py — wrapper's `if extract:` block only called
triples.add_facts(), never _store_facts_in_table().

These tests assert wrapper / direct parity across all four observable
effects of extract=True:
  1. triples table populated
  2. facts table populated
  3. recall() can find the memory
  4. fact_recall() can find the fact

Plus a parity check for extract_entities=True.
