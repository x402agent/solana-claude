# Mnemosyne vs Hindsight Self-Hosted

**Last updated:** 2026-05-07 · Mnemosyne v2.4

This is an honest, technical comparison between Mnemosyne and Hindsight self-hosted (local Docker, not the managed Cloud product). Every claim below is grounded in source code — no fabricated benchmarks or aspirational APIs.

> **TL;DR:** They are not direct competitors. Hindsight is a **memory engine** with sophisticated NLP and multi-signal retrieval. Mnemosyne is a **memory layer** optimized for simplicity, speed, and single-machine deployments. Choose based on what you actually need.

## Architecture

| Dimension | Mnemosyne | Hindsight Self-Hosted |
|---|---|---|
| **Process model** | In-process Python library | Separate Docker containers (FastAPI + PostgreSQL) |
| **IPC overhead** | Zero (direct function calls) | HTTP + JSON serialization to localhost:8888 |
| **Database** | SQLite (single file, WAL mode) | PostgreSQL + pgvector extension |
| **Embedding model** | fastembed ONNX — BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5 (~67MB) | sentence-transformers PyTorch (~500MB) |
| **Vector search** | sqlite-vec (int8/bit/float32) or numpy fallback | pgvector HNSW (mature, optimized) |
| **Cold start** | Instant (if models cached locally) | ~5–10s (Docker container boot + model loading) |
| **Vector storage** | int8 (default): 384 bytes per 384-dim vector | float32: ~1536 bytes per 384-dim vector |
| | bit (optional): 48 bytes per 384-dim vector |  |
| **Runtime memory** | ~10–20MB per session (SQLite + ONNX) | ~100–300MB (PostgreSQL pool + PyTorch) |

---

## Setup

| Step | Mnemosyne | Hindsight Self-Hosted |
|---|---|---|
| Install | `pip install mnemosyne-memory` | `docker compose up` (requires Docker) |
| Dependencies (core) | Python stdlib + SQLite — nothing else | Docker, PostgreSQL, pgvector extension |
| Dependencies (semantic) | `pip install mnemosyne-memory[embeddings]` → fastembed (ONNX) | sentence-transformers (PyTorch) or TEI container |
| Dependencies (LLM) | `pip install mnemosyne-memory[llm]` → ctransformers + GGUF, or remote OpenAI-compatible API | Local LLM or remote API |
| Configuration | Zero config. Sensible defaults. Env vars optional. | YAML config, PostgreSQL connection, port bindings |
| Number of containers | 0 | 2–3 (API server, PostgreSQL, optional embedding worker) |

**Verdict:** Mnemosyne has a materially simpler install path. `pip install` vs Docker Compose is a real difference, especially on resource-constrained environments or ephemeral VMs.

## Memory Model

### Mnemosyne: BEAM (Bilevel Episodic-Associative Memory)

Three SQLite tables:

| Tier | Purpose | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| **Working memory** | Hot, recent context | Auto-injected into prompts via `pre_llm_call` hook. TTL-based eviction (default 24h). Max 10,000 items. FTS5 indexed. |
| **Episodic memory** | Long-term consolidated storage | Populated by `sleep()` consolidation. Hybrid vector + FTS5 search. |
| **Scratchpad** | Temporary agent workspace | Not searchable, not consolidated. Cleared explicitly. Max 1,000 items. |

Additional: **TripleStore** — temporal knowledge graph with `valid_from`/`valid_until` for point-in-time queries.

**Core operations:** `remember()`, `recall()`, `sleep()` — intentionally simple.

### Hindsight: Retain / Recall / Reflect

| Operation | Mnemosyne equivalent | Gap? |
|---|---|---|
| **Retain** — LLM-driven fact extraction, entity normalization, 2–5 structured facts per chunk | `remember()` stores raw text + optional embedding. `extract=True` enables LLM fact extraction. | **Partial gap.** Mnemosyne can extract facts via LLM but has no automatic entity normalization. |
| **Recall** — 4-way parallel (semantic + BM25 + graph + temporal), RRF fusion, cross-encoder rerank | `recall()` — hybrid (vector + FTS5 + importance) × recency decay. Single-pass. | **Design difference.** Mnemosyne is simpler by choice. |
| **Reflect** — Agentic loop with tool calling, mental models, disposition traits | `sleep()` — LLM summarization of working → episodic. No agentic loop, no mental models. | **Gap.** Mnemosyne does consolidation, not reasoning about knowledge. |

**Honest assessment:** Hindsight's model is more sophisticated. Mnemosyne's model is intentionally simpler — fewer moving parts, fewer failure modes, but also fewer capabilities.

## Retrieval

| Feature | Mnemosyne | Hindsight Self-Hosted |
|---|---|---|
| **Vector search** | sqlite-vec (cosine distance) | pgvector HNSW |
| **Keyword search** | SQLite FTS5 | PostgreSQL full-text + BM25 |
| **Graph search** | TripleStore (subject-predicate-object, temporal) | Native knowledge graph with co-occurrence tracking |
| **Temporal search** | `from_date`/`to_date` filters + configurable exponential decay boost (`temporal_weight`, `temporal_halflife`) | Native date parsing, `occurred_start/end`, temporal recall strategy |
| **Scoring formula** | `score = vec_weight × vec_sim + fts_weight × fts_rank + importance_weight × importance`, then × recency decay | 4-way parallel retrieval → RRF fusion → cross-encoder rerank |
| **Default weights** | 50% vector, 30% FTS, 20% importance | Learned fusion weights |
| **Configurable?** | Yes — `vec_weight`, `fts_weight`, `importance_weight` params per query, or via env vars | Yes — configurable strategies |
| **Reranking** | None (single-pass) | Cross-encoder rerank |

**The trade-off:** Mnemosyne's single-pass scoring is faster but less precise. Hindsight's 4-way + rerank pipeline finds more relevant results at the cost of latency and compute.

## Entity Extraction

| Feature | Mnemosyne | Hindsight Self-Hosted |
|---|---|---|
| **Method** | Regex patterns + pure Python Levenshtein distance | spaCy NLP pipeline + LLM extraction |
| **Patterns** | `@mentions`, `#hashtags`, `"quoted phrases"`, capitalized sequences (2–5 words) | Full NLP: named entities, noun phrases, coreference |
| **Fuzzy matching** | Levenshtein distance with prefix/substring bonuses. `"Abdias"` ≈ `"Abdias J"` (similarity: 0.925) | Trigram/full resolution strategies. Entity co-occurrence tracking. |
| **Storage** | TripleStore triples: `(memory_id, "mentions", "entity_name")` | Structured entity table with normalization |
| **Speed** | ~0.01ms per extraction | Heavier (spaCy model loading + inference) |
| **Accuracy** | Good for proper nouns, handles, hashtags. Misses pronouns, complex references. | Higher recall — resolves "she", "the project", complex entity mentions. |
| **Opt-in?** | `extract_entities=True` on `remember()` | Always on |

**Verdict:** Mnemosyne's regex approach is fast and dependency-free but misses many entity types that spaCy catches. This is a deliberate trade-off: speed and simplicity over NLP accuracy.

---

## Fact Extraction

| Feature | Mnemosyne | Hindsight Self-Hosted |
|---|---|---|
| **Method** | LLM-driven (`extraction.py`): sends text to LLM, parses 2–5 factual statements | LLM-driven Retain pipeline with provenance tracking |
| **Fallback chain** | Remote OpenAI-compatible API → local ctransformers GGUF → skip (graceful) | N/A (runs inside container) |
| **Storage** | TripleStore: `(memory_id, "fact", fact_text)` | Structured fact table with evidence tracking |
| **Opt-in?** | `extract=True` on `remember()` | Always on via Retain |
| **Automatic?** | No — caller must opt in per memory | Yes — automatic on all ingested text |

## Performance Characteristics

| Metric | Mnemosyne | Hindsight Self-Hosted |
|---|---|---|
| **Recall latency (10K corpus)** | ~2–10ms — in-process SQLite + sqlite-vec, no HTTP overhead | ~50–200ms — HTTP round-trip + PostgreSQL + 4-way retrieval + rerank |
| **IPC model** | Direct Python function call | HTTP POST to localhost:8888 → JSON serialization → response parsing |
| **Storage footprint** | ~50–100MB SQLite file per 10K memories | ~200–500MB PostgreSQL + WAL per 10K memories |
| **Model download** | One-time ~67MB (fastembed ONNX) | One-time ~500MB (sentence-transformers PyTorch) |
| **Runtime memory** | ~10–20MB per session | ~100–300MB (PostgreSQL pool + PyTorch runtime) |
| **Consolidation** | `sleep()` — LLM summarization or AAAK fallback, runs on-demand | Background consolidation engine with evidence tracking |

> **Important caveat on latency numbers:** Mnemosyne's latency advantage comes from being an in-process library calling SQLite directly, compared to HTTP round-trips to a local Docker container. This is an architectural advantage, not a retrieval-quality advantage. If Hindsight were called as a library (not over HTTP), the gap would narrow significantly.

## Dependency Profile

| Mode | Mnemosyne Dependencies | Network Calls |
|---|---|---|
| **Minimal (keyword only)** | Python stdlib + SQLite | **None** |
| **Semantic search** | + fastembed ONNX (~67MB one-time download) | **One-time** model download, then none |
| **Vector search in SQLite** | + sqlite-vec (pip-installable C extension) | None |
| **LLM consolidation** | + ctransformers + GGUF (~600MB), or remote API | **One-time** model download, or remote LLM API |
| **MCP server** | + mcp, starlette, uvicorn (for SSE) | None at runtime |

| Mode | Hindsight Dependencies | Network Calls |
|---|---|---|
| **Full stack** | Docker, PostgreSQL, pgvector, sentence-transformers | **One-time** model download, then none |
| **TEI variant** | + HuggingFace TEI container | None at runtime |

Both systems are fully offline after initial setup. The difference is weight: Mnemosyne's core is Python stdlib + SQLite. Hindsight requires Docker + PostgreSQL even for basic operation.

## When to Choose What

### Choose Mnemosyne if:

- You want `pip install` with zero containers
- You need the fastest possible recall latency for interactive agent loops
- You're running on a resource-constrained environment (VPS, ephemeral VM, CI)
- You're building a single-user, single-machine agent (Hermes, Claude Desktop, etc.)
- You want an MCP-compatible memory layer (stdio + SSE)
- You want full control over the memory model and don't need automatic "magic"
- You value fewer moving parts over sophisticated NLP
- You want memory banks with per-bank SQLite isolation without standing up PostgreSQL

### Choose Hindsight Self-Hosted if:

- You need entity resolution ("Abdias" and "Abdias J" are the same person)
- You need automatic structured fact extraction from raw text
- You need cross-machine memory sharing via network API
- You need multi-tenant memory banks with access control
- You need temporal reasoning ("what did I say last Tuesday?") with automatic date extraction
- You need the highest recall quality (4-way retrieval + cross-encoder rerank)
- You need an OpenClaw integration today (not planned)
- You're okay with Docker + PostgreSQL complexity as a trade-off for richer capabilities

### Neither is "better." They serve different points on the simplicity-sophistication spectrum.

## Known Gaps in Mnemosyne (honest list)

| Gap | Severity | Workaround |
|---|---|---|
| No automatic entity normalization | Medium | `extract_entities=True` captures entities; fuzzy matching helps but doesn't resolve coreference |
| No cross-machine network API | Medium for multi-agent setups | Export/import JSON; same-machine sharing via shared SQLite file. **Can now import FROM Hindsight directly** — migrate without data loss |
| No cross-encoder reranking | Low for most queries | Hybrid scoring with configurable weights covers common cases |
| No automatic conflict detection | Medium | Manual `invalidate(memory_id, replacement_id=new_id)` |
| No multi-tenancy / access control | High for SaaS use cases | Use per-bank SQLite isolation for domain separation |
| No mental models / agentic reflection | Low | `sleep()` does consolidation; reasoning about knowledge is the caller's job |
| OpenClaw adapter not yet built | Medium for OpenClaw users | Hermes integration is native; OpenClaw requires MCP adapter work |
| Temporal queries require explicit dates | Low | `valid_until` and `superseded_by` are manual; `TripleStore` supports `as_of` queries |
