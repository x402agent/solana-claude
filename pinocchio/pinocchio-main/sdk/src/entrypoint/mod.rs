//! Macros and functions for defining the program entrypoint and setting up
//! global handlers.
//!
//! When an instruction is directed at an executable program, the loader
//! configures the program's execution environment, serializes the program's
//! input parameters, invokes the program's entrypoint, and reports any errors
//! encountered. The input parameters are serialized into a byte array and
//! passed to the program's entrypoint. Each program is responsible for
//! deserializing these parameters on-chain.
//!
//! The input parameters are serialized as follows (all encoding is little
//! endian):
//!
//!```text
//! ┌─ 8 bytes unsigned (u64): number of accounts
//! │
//! ├─ For each account:
//! |   |
//! │   ├─ 1 byte: indicating if this is a duplicate account, if not a duplicate then
//! │   │          the value is 0xFF, otherwise the value is the index of the account
//! │   │          it is a duplicate of.
//! |   │
//! │   ├─ If the account is a duplicate:
//! |   |     |
//! │   │     └─ 7 bytes of padding
//! |   │
//! │   └─ If the account is not a duplicate:
//! |         |
//! │         ├─ 1 byte boolean, true if account is a signer
//! |         |
//! │         ├─ 1 byte boolean, true if account is writable
//! |         |
//! |         ├─ 1 byte boolean, true if account is executable
//! |         |
//! │         ├─ 4 bytes of padding (account data length stored here with `account-resize` feature)
//! |         |
//! │         ├─ 32 bytes: address of the account
//! |         |
//! │         ├─ 32 bytes: address of the program account owner
//! |         |
//! │         ├─ 8 bytes unsigned (u64): lamports held by the account
//! |         |

//! |         |
//! │         ├─ 10240 bytes of padding (used for resize)
//! |         |
//! │         ├─ <variable> bytes to align the offset to 8 bytes

/// # Important
///
/// The panic handler set up is different depending on whether the `std` library
/// is available to the linker or not. The `entrypoint` macro will set up a
/// default panic "hook", that works with the `#[panic_handler]` set by the
/// `std`. Therefore, this macro should be used when the program or any of its
/// dependencies are dependent on the `std` library.
///
/// When the program and all its dependencies are `no_std`, it is necessary to
/// set a `#[panic_handler]` to handle panics. This is done by the
/// [`crate::nostd_panic_handler`] macro. In this case, it is not possible to
/// use the `entrypoint` macro. Use the [`crate::program_entrypoint!`] macro
/// instead and set up the allocator and panic handler manually.
///
/// The compiler may inline the instruction handler (and its call tree) into the
/// generated `entrypoint`, which can significantly increase the entrypoint
/// stack frame. If your program has large instruction dispatch logic or builds
/// sizable CPI account arrays, consider adding `#[inline(never)]` to the
/// instruction handler to keep it out of the entrypoint stack frame and avoid
/// BPF stack overflows.
