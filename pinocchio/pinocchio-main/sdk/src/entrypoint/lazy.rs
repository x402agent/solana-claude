/// Declare the lazy program entrypoint.
///
/// This entrypoint is defined as *lazy* because it does not read the accounts
/// upfront. Instead, it provides an [`InstructionContext`] to the access input
/// information on demand. This is useful when the program needs more control
/// over the compute units it uses. The trade-off is that the program is
/// responsible for managing potential duplicated accounts and set up a `global
/// allocator` and `panic handler`.
///
/// The usual use-case for a [`crate::lazy_program_entrypoint!`] is small
/// programs with a single instruction. For most use-cases, it is recommended to
/// use the [`crate::program_entrypoint!`] macro instead.
///
/// This macro emits the boilerplate necessary to begin program execution,
/// calling a provided function to process the program instruction supplied by
/// the runtime, and reporting its result to the runtime. Note that it does not
/// set up a global allocator nor a panic handler.
///
/// The only argument is the name of a function with this type signature:
///
/// ```ignore
/// fn process_instruction(
///    mut context: InstructionContext, // wrapper around the input buffer
/// ) -> ProgramResult;
/// ```
///
/// # Example
///
/// Defining an entrypoint and making it conditional on the `bpf-entrypoint`
/// feature. Although the `entrypoint` module is written inline in this example,
/// it is common to put it into its own file.
///
/// ```no_run
