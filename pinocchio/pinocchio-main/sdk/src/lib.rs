#![no_std]
#![cfg_attr(docsrs, feature(doc_cfg))]

//! A library for creating Solana programs in Rust with no external
//! dependencies. The only dependencies are types from the Solana SDK
//! specifically designed for on-chain programs. This mitigates dependency
//! issues and offers an efficient zero-copy library for writing programs,
//! optimized in terms of both compute unit consumption and binary size.
//!
//! ## Defining the program entrypoint
//!
//! A Solana program needs to define an entrypoint, which will be called by the
//! runtime to begin the program execution. The `entrypoint!` macro emits the
//! common boilerplate to set up the program entrypoint. The macro will also set
//! up [global allocator](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/core/alloc/trait.GlobalAlloc.html)
//! and [panic handler](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/panic-handler.html) using
//! the [`default_allocator!`] and [`default_panic_handler!`] macros.
//!
//! The [`entrypoint!`](https://docs.rs/pinocchio/latest/pinocchio/macro.entrypoint.html)
//! is a convenience macro that invokes three other macros to set all components
//! required for a program execution:
//!
//! * [`program_entrypoint!`]: declares the program entrypoint
//! * [`default_allocator!`]: declares the default (bump) global allocator
//! * [`default_panic_handler!`]: declares the default panic "hook" that works
//!   in combination with the `std` panic handler
//!
//! When all dependencies are `no_std`, you should use [`nostd_panic_handler!`](https://docs.rs/pinocchio/latest/pinocchio/macro.nostd_panic_handler.html)
//! instead of `default_panic_handler!` to declare a rust runtime panic handler.
//! There's no need to do this when any dependency is `std` since rust compiler
//! will emit a panic handler.
//!
//! To use the `entrypoint!` macro, use the following in your entrypoint
//! definition:
//! ```ignore
//! use pinocchio::{
//!   AccountView,
//!   Address,
//!   entrypoint,
//!   ProgramResult
//! };
//! use solana_program_log::log;
//!
//! entrypoint!(process_instruction);
//!
//! pub fn process_instruction(
//!   program_id: &Address,
//!   accounts: &mut [AccountView],
//!   instruction_data: &[u8],
//! ) -> ProgramResult {
//!   log!("Hello from my pinocchio program!");
//!   Ok(())
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! The input is parsed into the following components:
//!
//! * `program_id`: the `ID` of the program being called
//! * `accounts`: the accounts received
//! * `instruction_data`: data for the instruction
//!
//! `pinocchio` also offers variations of the program entrypoint
//! (`lazy_program_entrypoint`) and global allocator (`no_allocator`). In order
//! to use these, the program needs to specify the program entrypoint, global
//! allocator and panic handler individually. The `entrypoint!` macro is
//! equivalent to writing:
//! ```ignore
//! program_entrypoint!(process_instruction);
//! default_allocator!();
//! default_panic_handler!();
//! ```
//! Any of these macros can be replaced by alternative implementations.
//!
//! ### Custom entrypoints with [`crate::entrypoint::process_entrypoint`]
//!
//! For programs that need maximum control over the entrypoint, `pinocchio`
//! exposes the [`crate::entrypoint::process_entrypoint`] function. This
//! function is the same deserialization logic used internally by the
//! [`program_entrypoint!`] macro, exposed as a public API and can be called
//! directly from a custom entrypoint, allowing you to implement fast-path
//! optimizations or custom pre-processing logic before falling back to standard
//! input parsing.
//!
//! To use [`crate::entrypoint::process_entrypoint`] in a custom entrypoint:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use pinocchio::{
//!   AccountView,
//!   Address,
//!   default_panic_handler,
//!   entrypoint::process_entrypoint,
//!   MAX_TX_ACCOUNTS,
//!   no_allocator,
//!   ProgramResult,
//! };
//! use solana_program_log::log;
//!
//! no_allocator!();
//! default_panic_handler!();
//!
//! #[no_mangle]
//! pub unsafe extern "C" fn entrypoint(input: *mut u8) -> u64 {
//!   // Fast path: check the number of accounts
//!   let num_accounts = unsafe { *(input as *const u64) };
//!   if num_accounts == 0 {
//!     log("Fast path - no accounts!");
//!     return 0;
//!   }
//!
//!   // Standard path: delegate to `process_entrypoint`
//!   unsafe { process_entrypoint::<MAX_TX_ACCOUNTS>(input, process_instruction) }
//! }
//!
//! pub fn process_instruction(
//!   program_id: &Address,
//!   accounts: &mut [AccountView],
//!   instruction_data: &[u8],
//! ) -> ProgramResult {
//!   log("Standard path");
//!   Ok(())
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ### [`lazy_program_entrypoint!`]
//!
//! The [`entrypoint!`] macro looks similar to the "standard" one found in
//! [`solana-program-entrypoint`](https://docs.rs/solana-program-entrypoint/latest/solana_program_entrypoint/macro.entrypoint.html).
//! It parses the whole input and provides the `program_id`, `accounts` and
//! `instruction_data` separately. This consumes compute units before the
//! program begins its execution. In some cases, it is beneficial for a program
//! to have more control over when input parsing happens, including whether
//! parsing is needed at all - this is the purpose of the
//! [`lazy_program_entrypoint!`] macro. This macro only wraps the program input
//! and provides methods to parse the input on-demand.
//!
//! The [`lazy_program_entrypoint`] is suitable for programs that have a single
//! or very few instructions, since it requires the program to handle the
//! parsing, which can become complex as the number of instructions increases.
//! For *larger* programs, the [`program_entrypoint!`] will likely be easier and
//! more efficient to use.
//!
//! To use the [`lazy_program_entrypoint!`] macro, use the following in your
//! entrypoint definition:
//! ```ignore
//! use pinocchio::{
//!   default_allocator,
//!   default_panic_handler,
//!   entrypoint::InstructionContext,
//!   lazy_program_entrypoint,
//!   ProgramResult
//! };
//!
//! lazy_program_entrypoint!(process_instruction);
//! default_allocator!();
//! default_panic_handler!();
//!
//! pub fn process_instruction(
//!   mut context: InstructionContext
//! ) -> ProgramResult {
//!   Ok(())
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! The [`InstructionContext`](entrypoint::InstructionContext) provides
//! on-demand access to the information of the input:
//!
//! * [`remaining()`](entrypoint::InstructionContext::remaining): number of
//!   available accounts to parse; this number is decremented as the program
//!   parses accounts.
//! * [`next_account()`](entrypoint::InstructionContext::next_account): parses
//!   the next available account (can be used as many times as accounts
//!   available).
//! * [`instruction_data()`](entrypoint::InstructionContext::instruction_data):
//!   parses the instruction data.
//! * [`program_id()`](entrypoint::InstructionContext::program_id): parses the
//!   program id.
//!
//!
//! 💡 The [`lazy_program_entrypoint!`] does not set up a global allocator nor a
//! panic handler. A program should explicitly use one of the provided macros to
//! set them up or include its own implementation.
//!
//! ### [`no_allocator!`]
//!
//! When writing programs, it can be useful to make sure the program does not
//! attempt to make any allocations. In these cases, Pinocchio includes a
//! [`no_allocator!`] macro that sets a global allocator that panics on any
//! attempt to allocate memory.
//!
//! To use the [`no_allocator!`] macro, use the following in your entrypoint
//! definition:
//! ```ignore
//! use pinocchio::{
//!   AccountView,
//!   Address,
//!   default_panic_handler,
//!   no_allocator,
//!   program_entrypoint,
//!   ProgramResult
//! };
//!
//! program_entrypoint!(process_instruction);
//! default_panic_handler!();
//! no_allocator!();
//!
//! pub fn process_instruction(
//!   program_id: &Address,
//!   accounts: &mut [AccountView],
//!   instruction_data: &[u8],
//! ) -> ProgramResult {
//!   Ok(())
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! 💡 The [`no_allocator!`] macro can also be used in combination with the
//! [`lazy_program_entrypoint!`].
//!
//! Since the `no_allocator!` macro does not allocate memory, the `32kb` memory
//! region reserved for the heap remains unused. To take advantage of this, the
//! `no_allocator!` macro emits an `allocate_unchecked` helper function that
//! allows you to manually reserve memory for a type at compile time.
//! ```ignore
//! // static allocation:
//! //    - 0 is the offset when the type will be allocated
//! //    - `allocate_unchecked` returns a mutable reference to the allocated
//! type let lamports = allocate_unchecked::<u64>(0);
//! *lamports = 1_000_000_000;
//! ```
//!
//! Note that it is the developer's responsibility to ensure that types do not
//! overlap in memory - the `offset + <size of type>` of different types must
//! not overlap.
//!
//! ### [`nostd_panic_handler!`]
//!
//! When writing `no_std` programs, it is necessary to declare a panic handler
//! using the [`nostd_panic_handler!`] macro. This macro sets up a default panic
//! handler that logs the location (file, line and column) where the panic
//! occurred and then calls the `abort()` syscall.
//!
//! 💡 The `default_panic_handler!` macro only works in an `std` context.
//!
//! ## Crate features
//!
//! ### `alloc`
//!
//! The `alloc` feature is enabled by default and it uses the [`alloc`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/alloc/)
//! crate. This provides access to dynamic memory allocation in combination with
//! the [`default_allocator!`], e.g., required to use `String` and `Vec` in a
//! program. Helpers that need to allocate memory, such as fetching
//! [`crate::sysvars::slot_hashes::SlotHashes::fetch`] sysvar data, are also
//! available.
//!
//! When no allocation is needed or desired, the feature can be disabled:
//! ```ignore
//! pinocchio = { version = "0.11", default-features = false }
//! ```
//!
//! ### `copy`
//!
//! The `copy` feature enables the derivation of the `Copy` trait for types. It
//! also enables the `copy` feature on the `solana-account-view` and
//! `solana-address` re-exports.
//!
//! ### `cpi`
//!
//! The `cpi` feature enables the cross-program invocation helpers, as well as
//! types to define instructions and signer information.
//! ```ignore
//! pinocchio = { version = "0.11", features = ["cpi"] }
//! ```
//!
//! ### `account-resize`
//!
//! The `account-resize` feature allows a program to grow or shrink an
//! `AccountView`'s data at runtime. At the start of execution, the entrypoint
//! stores the original data length so it can verify that the resize stays
//! within the permitted bounds. This operation consumes `2` CUs per account.
//!
//! ### `unsafe-account-resize`
//!
//! The `unsafe-account-resize` feature, like `account-resize`, allows a program
//! to grow or shrink an `AccountView`'s data at runtime. Unlike
//! `account-resize`, it does not validate the new size, so it adds no
//! entrypoint overhead. The program must ensure that the account remains within
//! the permitted bounds.
//!
//! ## Advanced entrypoint configuration
//!
//! The symbols emitted by the entrypoint macros - program entrypoint, global
//! allocator and default panic handler - can only be defined once globally. If
//! the program crate is also intended to be used as a library, it is common
//! practice to define a Cargo [feature](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/features.html)
//! in your program crate to conditionally enable the module that includes the
//! [`entrypoint!`] macro invocation. The convention is to name the feature
//! `bpf-entrypoint`.
//! ```ignore
//! #[cfg(feature = "bpf-entrypoint")]
//! mod entrypoint {
//!   use pinocchio::{
//!     AccountView,
//!     Address,
//!     entrypoint,
//!     ProgramResult
//!   };
//!
//!   entrypoint!(process_instruction);
//!
//!   pub fn process_instruction(
//!     program_id: &Address,
//!     accounts: &mut [AccountView],
//!     instruction_data: &[u8],
//!   ) -> ProgramResult {
//!     Ok(())
//!   }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! When building the program binary, you must enable the `bpf-entrypoint`
//! feature:
//! ```ignore
//! cargo build-sbf --features bpf-entrypoint
//! ```
//!
//! ## Upstream BPF compatibility
//!
//! Pinocchio is compatible with the upstream BPF target (`target_arch = bpf`).
//! When using syscalls (e.g., cross-program invocations), it is necessary to
//! explicitly enable static syscalls in your program's `Cargo.toml`:
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! # Enable static syscalls for BPF target
//! solana-define-syscall = { version = "5.0", features = ["unstable-static-syscalls"] }
//! ```
//!
//! When compiling your program with the upstream BPF target, the `std` library
//! is not available. Therefore, the program crate must include the `#![no_std]`
//! crate-level attribute and use the [`nostd_panic_handler!`] macro. An
//! allocator may be used as long as `alloc` is used.
