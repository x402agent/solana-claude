# Vulcan

Agent and human-friendly CLI for trading perpetual futures on [Phoenix](https://phoenix.trade).

> ⚠️ **Experimental software:** live commands can execute irreversible financial transactions on Solana Mainnet. You are responsible for wallet security, agent permissions, and all trading outcomes.

## What Vulcan Provides

- Account, margin, position, and order management for Phoenix perps.
- Local paper trading with live market prices and no wallet required.
- A local MCP server so agents can use Vulcan tools directly.
- First-class strategy runners for TWAP, grid trading, and TA.
- Bundled Agent Skills for Cursor, Claude Code, Codex, and Agentskills/OpenClaw-style clients.

### Example Agent Prompts

> "Give me a full portfolio snapshot: cross + isolated margin health, open positions with unrealized PnL %, resting orders, and any funding exposure I should know about."
>
> "Scan the top 5 markets on Phoenix by 24h volume — give me funding rate, mark price, and a one-line take on each."
>
> "Open a $200 long on SOL then attach a TP at +5% and SL at -3%."
>
> "I need to long $5,000 of SOL. Run a TWAP over 20 minutes in 10 slices.
>
> "Watch BTC on 15m and alert me when EMA(9) crosses EMA(21), paper only"
>
> "Build a TA strategy that goes long when RSI(14) crosses above 30 on the 5m and exits when it crosses 70. Paper mode first, $500 per entry"

## Install

Install the latest release on macOS/Linux:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/Ellipsis-Labs/vulcan-cli/releases/latest/download/install.sh | sh
```

The installer verifies the release archive against `vulcan-checksums-sha256.txt` and installs to `~/.local/bin/vulcan` by default. Make sure `~/.local/bin` is on your `PATH`.

Install a specific version:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/Ellipsis-Labs/vulcan-cli/releases/download/v0.5.3/install.sh | sh
```

Build from source:

```bash
cargo install --path vulcan
```

Verify:

```bash
vulcan version
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Guided setup for config, wallet, registration, deposit, and agent options
vulcan setup

# Check installation, config, wallet, RPC/API, registration, and paper readiness
vulcan status -o json

# Read market data
vulcan market list -o json
vulcan market ticker SOL -o json

# Begin paper trading
vulcan paper init --balance 10000 -o json
vulcan paper buy SOL --notional-usdc 100 --type market -o json
vulcan paper status -o json
```

## Agent Setup

Vulcan installs a local MCP server and a bundled set of Agent Skills into your agent host (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, or any agentskills-compatible client). Two commands per host: one to install the skill files, one to register the MCP server. Live trading is opt-in.

Supported `--target` values: `claude`, `cursor`, `codex`, `agentskills`. `--scope user` writes to your user-level config (default); `--scope project` writes to the current project.

### Step 1: Install skills + MCP server (read-only / paper-safe)

```bash
# Bundled Agent Skills (workflow guides, recipes, runtime contract)
vulcan agent install --target claude --scope user

# Register the Vulcan MCP server with the host's standard config file
vulcan agent mcp install --target claude --scope user

# End-to-end probe: spawn the server, handshake, assert vulcan_* tools appear
vulcan agent mcp diagnose --target claude --scope user
```

**Fully restart your host** afterward so it picks up the new MCP server.

### Step 2 (optional): Enable live trading

Live trading requires a stored wallet to unlock for signing and live signing permission. You can setup at install time with `--dangerous`

```bash
# Wire up the wallet for live signing.
# Prompts for the wallet password interactively, validates decryption
vulcan agent mcp install --target claude --scope user --dangerous
```

After restart, dangerous tools (live trades, deposits, withdrawals, cancellations) appear in the agent's tool list and can be invoked with `acknowledged: true`.

> ⚠️ Both flows write your wallet password into the host's MCP config file on disk. The file is created `chmod 0600` — protect it like any other credential file.

### Switching wallets later

```bash
vulcan agent mcp set-wallet <wallet-name> --target claude --scope user
```

### Inspecting and repairing

```bash
# Show what's installed and what's missing per host
vulcan agent mcp doctor --target claude --scope user

# Reinstall command path / args while preserving the wallet password env
vulcan agent mcp install --target claude --scope user --repair

# Combined readiness check across all configured hosts
vulcan strategy preflight
```

### Running MCP standalone

For local testing or custom orchestration without a host:

```bash
# Read-only / paper-safe
vulcan mcp

# Live-capable
export VULCAN_WALLET_NAME=my-wallet
export VULCAN_WALLET_PASSWORD=your-password
vulcan mcp --allow-dangerous
```

`VULCAN_WALLET_NAME` selects a stored wallet; if omitted, Vulcan uses the default wallet. `VULCAN_WALLET_PASSWORD` is required when `--allow-dangerous` is set; empty strings are treated as unset.

Dangerous tools require both:

1. MCP server started with `--allow-dangerous`.
2. `acknowledged: true` on each dangerous tool call.

### Agent context, skills, and catalogs

- `vulcan://context` or `vulcan agent-context` — canonical runtime contract.
- `vulcan://skills/index` or `skills/INDEX.md` — workflow skill index.
- `vulcan://agents/tool-catalog` or `agents/tool-catalog.json` — exact tool schemas.
- `vulcan://agents/error-catalog` or `agents/error-catalog.json` — error codes and recovery hints.

Plaintext private-key export is user-only. Agents should explain the risk and provide the command for the user to run locally, but should not execute it.

See `AGENTS.md` for full integration details.

## Strategies

Use first-class runners when Vulcan provides the strategy. Runners own the loop, perform launch-time checks for live modes, persist structured tick logs and ledgers under `~/.vulcan/strategy-runs`, and produce status/report output.

Supported runners:

- TWAP: split a larger order into timed slices.
- Grid: maintain layered limit orders across a price range.
- TA: rule-based runner over technical indicators for entry/exit.

Modes:

- `paper` - local simulation against live prices.
- `dry_run` - plan intended live actions without submitting transactions.
- `confirm_each` - live mode with confirmation before each execution step.
- `auto_execute` - live mode after explicit approval for the configured parameters.

Examples:

```bash
vulcan strategy twap start --symbol SOL --side buy --notional-usdc 1000 --slices 5 --interval-seconds 30 --mode paper -o json
vulcan strategy runs -o json
vulcan strategy monitor <RUN_ID> -o json
vulcan strategy finalize <RUN_ID> --cancel-orders --wait --yes -o json
```

For agent-specific strategy behavior, see `CONTEXT.md`, `skills/vulcan-twap-execution/SKILL.md`, and `skills/vulcan-grid-trading/SKILL.md`.
