        description = r#"Make an HTTP request through Pay with 402 Payment Required handling.

Use this as the primary HTTP tool for Pay gateway URLs and for any URL that
returns HTTP 402. The tool prepares MPP, x402, or SIWX credentials, asks for
local wallet approval when payment is required, then retries the original
request with the proof. The active Pay account only needs supported
stablecoins such as USDC, USDT, PYUSD, CASH, or USDG; it does not need SOL for network fees.
Server-side fee payers handle transaction fees and setup costs. Copy URLs
returned by `search_catalog` or `get_catalog_entry` exactly; do not replace
them with upstream API hosts.

`body` may be a string or a JSON value. JSON values are serialized before the
request and `Content-Type: application/json` is added when no content type is
provided.

For URLs that match a cached Pay catalog endpoint with an inlined OpenAPI
document, Pay validates the method and JSON request body locally before sending.
If required fields or types are wrong, the tool returns a clear validation error
and does not submit the request or payment.

        description = r#"Search paid API services for a user task and return ranked candidates with endpoint context.

Use this for actionable Pay-owned tasks after the user asks to do something,
such as "search Instagram influencers in Paris" or "run SQL over public crypto
datasets". Do not use this as the first tool for capability questions like
"can I use Pay to X?", "can I order X with Pay?", "does Pay support X?", or
"what can Pay do?". For those, call `list_catalog` first because search ranks a
task and can miss adjacent catalog providers. The response is ranked and
includes reasons, endpoint/pricing candidates, tie-breaker guidance, call-plan
fields, and the next provider-selection step. Select an endpoint only when it
clearly matches the task; otherwise inspect one likely provider with
`get_catalog_entry` or ask the user.

    #[tool(description = r#"List all available Pay APIs/skills.

Use this first for Pay capability and feasibility questions: "can I use Pay to
X?", "can I order X with Pay?", "does Pay support X?", "what can Pay do?", or
similar. Never answer "no" about Pay capabilities from memory or from a
`search_catalog` result alone; inspect the full catalog with this tool first.
Returns a compact category-grouped catalog by default to keep MCP hosts
responsive. Set `include_details` only when the user needs the expanded raw
service list with use cases. For actionable execution after capability is
established, call `search_catalog` with the user's task. When the user asks what
Pay can do, present the catalog grouped by category so they can scan available
APIs/skills.

this after picking a service from `search_catalog` when endpoint candidates are
not enough to make a precise paid-call plan.

Returns stablecoin balances for the currently configured account. Paid API
calls spend supported stablecoins such as USDC, USDT, PYUSD, CASH, or USDG; the account does

setup costs. Use this to check available funds before making paid API calls.

        description = r#"Generate a top-up QR code PNG for the user's Pay account.

Use this when the user asks to top up, fund, add money, deposit stablecoins, or
create a QR code for adding funds to Pay. The user must choose the top-up method:
`mobile_wallet` for a Solana Pay USDC QR code, or `onramp` for a provider QR
code. When `method` is `onramp`, the user must also specify the provider
(`coinbase`, `paypal`, or `venmo`). This tool does not spend funds or initiate
a purchase; it only renders the QR PNG and returns the funding address.

    #[tool(description = r#"Create or validate a pay-skills provider listing.

Use this when a developer wants to publish a payment-gated API in
https://github.com/solana-foundation/pay-skills. Pass the complete provider
markdown file as `content`: YAML frontmatter between `---` delimiters followed
by optional execution notes. The tool validates required metadata, endpoint
shape, URL safety, pricing precision, and paid-endpoint expectations.

Before calling, inspect real code, OpenAPI specs, deployed routes, or
`pay server start` YAML. Do not invent endpoints, prices, supported networks,
or payment protocols. If runtime YAML exists, use `pay skills provider sync`
as a starting point, then validate the generated markdown with this tool.

`references/monetize-api.md`.
