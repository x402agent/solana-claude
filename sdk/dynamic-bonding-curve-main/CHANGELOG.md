## dynamic_bonding_curve [0.1.10] [PR #174](https://github.com/MeteoraAg/dynamic-bonding-curve/pull/174)

### Added

- Add new endpoint `create_operator_account` and `close_operator_account` that allows admin to manage different operator accounts.
- Add new account `Operator`, that would stores `whitelisted_address` as well as their operational permissions
- Add new endpoint `zap_protocol_fee` that allow operator to claim protocol fees and zap out to SOL/USDC or other token in pool and send to treasury address
- Add support for damm-v2 Compounding `collect_fee_mode`. This can be enabled through the `create_config` endpoint by passing `migrated_pool_fee.collect_fee_mode: 2` and `compounding_fee_bps: 1-10_000` field in `ConfigParameters`

### Changed

- When migrate to damm-v2, instead of using external accounts for vesting, now we will use position itself, that would save 2 accounts for damm-v2 migration instruction.

### Removed

- Removed the `create_claim_protocol_fee_operator` endpoint in favor of `create_operator_account`, which can create an operator account configured with permissions, including claiming protocol fees.

## dynamic_bonding_curve [0.1.9] [PR #165](https://github.com/MeteoraAg/dynamic-bonding-curve/pull/165)

### Added

- Added 2 new field `migrated_pool_base_fee_mode` and `MigratedPoolMarketCapFeeSchedulerParams` in `create_config` endpoint to allow user to create config with DAMM v2 migration with market cap fee scheduler.
- Added field `enable_first_swap_with_min_fee` in `create_config` endpoint to allow user to initialize pool and swap in single transaction without any anti sniper suite fee.

### Changed

- Endpoint `swap` and `swap2` require sysvar instruction account to be passed in remaining accounts if the config have `enable_first_swap_with_min_fee` as `true` to enjoy minimum swap fee. Else, it will charge normal fee.
- Standalize error code for quoting in swap exact in and swap exact out when bonding curve is not enough liquidity.
- Charge protocol migration fee upon migration. It take a cut from liquidity to be migrated to.

### Removed

- Remove endpoint `protocol_withdraw_surplus`, and merge surplus claiming to endpoint `claim_protocol_fee`
- Remove endpoint `claim_legacy_pool_creation_fee`, and merge `legacy_pool_creation_fee` to endpoint `claim_protocol_pool_creation_fee`

### Breaking Changes

- Add `fee_receiver` field to event `EvtPartnerClaimPoolCreationFee`.
- Endpoint `claim_protocol_fee` add new params `max_base_amount` and `max_quote_amount`
- Remove endpoint `protocol_withdraw_surplus`, surplus amount will be merged in endpoint `claim_protocol_fee`

## dynamic_bonding_curve [0.1.8] [PR #151](https://github.com/MeteoraAg/dynamic-bonding-curve/pull/151)

### Added

- Add new endpoint `claim_partner_pool_creation_fee` to allow partners to withdraw the pool creation fee.
- Add new endpoint `claim_protocol_pool_creation_fee` to allow protocol to withdraw the pool creation fee.
- `PoolConfig` account now stores `creator_lp_vesting_info` and `partner_lp_vesting_info` fields. Only applicable to DAMM v2 migration option. It store vesting parameters required for `lock_position` cpi during DAMM v2 migration.

### Changed

- Allow partners to configure the `pool_creation_fee` when creating a config. The value is in SOL lamport, so when token creator create pool (throught endpoint `initialize_virtual_pool_with_spl_token` and `initialize_virtual_pool_with_token2022`), they would need to pay `pool_creation_fee` in SOL lamport. Later partner would be able to claim that fee (Meteora would take 10% from that fee)
- Allow partners to config `partner_lp_vesting_info` and `creator_lp_vesting_info` when creating config key that includes liquidity vesting information if pool is migrated to damm v2 later

### Removed

- Removed the legacy pool creation fee logic from the `initialize_virtual_pool_with_token2022` endpoint.
- Removed `protocol_fee_percentage` and `referral_fee_percentage` fields from `PoolFeesConfig` field from `PoolConfig` account. Will be using defined constant `PROTOCOL_FEE_PERCENTAGE` and `HOST_FEE_PERCENTAGE` as replacement.

### Breaking Changes

- Endpoints: `create_config`, `initialize_virtual_pool_with_spl_token` and `initialize_virtual_pool_with_token2022` will only allow config that has minimum 10% of locked liquidity in at least 1 day
- `migration_damm_v2` endpoint require `vesting` accounts for `first_position` and `second_position` if LP vesting was configured.

All breaking belows are related to admin/operator functions

- Remove endpoint `withdraw_lamports_from_pool_authority`
- Change endpoint `claim_pool_creation_fee` to new endpoint `claim_legacy_pool_creation_fee`
- Add new `payer` account in admin endpoint `create_claim_fee_operator`, that allow to payer to pay rent fee, instead of admin
- Add new accounts `signer` and `claim_fee_operator` in endpoint `protocol_withdraw_surplus`, move the endpoint to permissioned

## dynamic_bonding_curve [0.1.7] [PR #129](https://github.com/MeteoraAg/dynamic-bonding-curve/pull/129)

### Changed

- A pool creation fee of 0.01 SOL will be charged if the pool `collect_fee_mode` is `CollectFeeMode::OutputToken` and `base_mint` is `token_2022` (endpoint: `initialize_virtual_pool_with_token2022`)
- Optimize SOL transferred to pool authority during migration by transferring only necessary needed amount. Implement flash rent in migration to damm and damm v2 as well as create locker that requires at least 1 SOL in `pool authority`
- Increase max migrate fee to 99%

### Added

- Adding new endpoint `claim_pool_creation_fee` to claim pool creation fee charged to treasury
- Adding new endpoint `withdraw_lamports_from_pool_authority` to withdraw excessive lamports to treasury

### Deprecated

- Endpoint `migration_damm_v2_create_metadata` and `migration_metadata` account, migrator doesn't need `migration_metadata` anymore in damm v2

### Fixed

- Using `saturating_sub` instead of `safe_sub` for `elapsed` calculation
- Rate limiter is not apply for swap2
- Validating base fee for rate limiter

### Breaking Changes

- Swap ExactIn and SwapExactOut won't take surplus for the last swap, instead of returning error if `pool.sqrt_price` is over `migration_sqrt_price`
- Changing min base fee from 1 bps (0.01%) to 25 bps (0.25%). Effected to endpoints: `create_config`, `initialize_virtual_pool_with_spl_token` and `initialize_virtual_pool_with_token2022`. Not able to work if min base fee less than 25 bps.

## dynamic_bonding_curve [0.1.6] [PR #119](https://github.com/MeteoraAg/dynamic-bonding-curve/pull/119)

### Added

- Add new endpoint `swap2`, that includes 3 `swap_mode`: 0 (ExactIn), 1 (PartialFill) and 2 (ExactOut)
- Emit new event in 2 swap endpoints `EvtSwap2`, that includes more information about `quote_reserve_amount`, `migration_threshold` and `included_fee_input_amount`

## dynamic_bonding_curve [0.1.5] [PR #113](https://github.com/MeteoraAg/dynamic-bonding-curve/pull/113)

### Added

- Allow more option for migration fee on Damm V2, and partner can config a customizable fee when token is migrated.
- Migrator needs to check the new value for `migration_fee_option`, if the value is 6 (Customizable), then need to use the new config key for DammV2 migration (A8gMrEPJkacWkcb3DGwtJwTe16HktSEfvwtuDh2MCtck)
- Emit new event when partner create a new config key, that includes more information: `EvtCreateConfigV2`

## dynamic_bonding_curve [0.1.4] [PR #100](https://github.com/MeteoraAg/dynamic-bonding-curve/pull/100)

### Added

- Allow more options for token authority configuration: `PartnerUpdateAuthority`, `CreatorUpdateAndMintAuthority` and `PartnerUpdateAndMintAuthority`

## dynamic_bonding_curve [0.1.3] [PR #89](https://github.com/MeteoraAg/dynamic-bonding-curve/pull/89)

### Added

- Allow partner to config another mode for base fee, called rate limiter. With the mode is enable, fee slope will increase if user buy with higher amount. The rate limiter mode is only available if collect fee mode is in quote token only, and when user buy token (not sell). Rate limiter doesn't allow user to send multiple swap instructions (or CPI) to the same pool in 1 transaction

### Changed

- In base fee, we rename: `reduction_factor` to `third_factor`, `period_frequency` to `second_factor`, `number_of_period` to `first_factor`.
- Add a new field `base_fee_mode` in base fee state, that indicates whether the base fee is fee scheduler or rate limiter

### Breaking Changes

- Update max fee to 99%
- In swap instruction, if rate limiter is enable, user need to submit `instruction_sysvar_account` in remaining account, otherwise transaction will be failed
- Quote function can be changed by rate limiter and updated max fee

## dynamic_bonding_curve [0.1.2] [PR #87](https://github.com/MeteoraAg/dynamic-bonding-curve/pull/87)

### Added

- Add new endpoint `transfer_pool_creator` to allow pool creator to transfer to new creator
- When creating config, partner can specify the field `token_update_authority`. 0: creator can update token metadata, 1: creator can't update token metadata
- Allow partner to config migration fee, add new endpoint `withdraw_migration_fee`, so partner and creator can withdraw migration fee

### Changed

- Config state add a new field: `token_update_authority`, `migration_fee_percentage` and `creator_migration_fee_percentage`

## dynamic_bonding_curve [0.1.1] [PR #71](https://github.com/MeteoraAg/dynamic-bonding-curve/pull/71)

### Added

- Allow more migrated fee options (4% and 6%)
- Allow partner to specify `creator_trading_fee_percentage` when creating config key. Trading fee and surplus will be shared between partner and creator.
- Creator can claim trading fee and surplus through 2 endpoints: `claim_creator_trading_fee` and `creator_withdraw_surplus`

### Changed

- Rename `trading_base_fee` to `partner_base_fee` and `trading_quote_fee` to `partner_quote_fee` in VirtualPool state
- Add new field `creator_base_fee` and `creator_quote_fee` to track creator trading fee in VirtualPool state
