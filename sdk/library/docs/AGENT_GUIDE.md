# Agent Creation Guide

## Overview

Agents in AI Agents Library are specialized AI assistants designed to handle specific tasks in DeFi, crypto, and Web3. This guide will help you create effective agents for the marketplace.

## Agent Anatomy

### Basic Structure

```json
{
  "author": "your-github-username",
  "config": {
    "systemRole": "Your detailed system prompt here..."
  },
  "identifier": "unique-agent-id",
  "meta": {
    "title": "Agent Display Name",
    "description": "Clear, concise description (max 200 characters)",
    "avatar": "🤖",
    "tags": ["defi", "trading", "analytics"],
    "systemRole": "agent"
  },
  "schemaVersion": 1
}
```

### Key Components

**identifier**: URL-safe name (lowercase, hyphens, no spaces)

- Good: `sperax-yield-optimizer`, `defi-portfolio-analyzer`
- Bad: `My Agent!`, `DeFi Agent v2`

**title**: Display name (user-facing, can have spaces/caps)

**description**: Brief summary visible in marketplace (160-200 chars optimal)

**avatar**: Single emoji that represents your agent's function

**tags**: 3-8 relevant keywords for discovery

**systemRole**: The core prompt that defines agent behavior

## Writing Effective System Prompts

### Structure Template

```
You are [ROLE/IDENTITY]

CAPABILITIES:
- [What the agent can do]
- [Key specialization]
- [Tools/knowledge available]

GUIDELINES:
- [How to approach tasks]
- [Response format]
- [Constraints/limitations]

WORKFLOW:
1. [Step-by-step process]
2. [How to handle specific scenarios]

EXAMPLES:
[Optional: Demonstrate desired behavior]
```

### DeFi Agent Example

```json
{
  "systemRole": "You are a DeFi Yield Optimization Specialist focusing on the AI Agents Library ecosystem.

CAPABILITIES:
- Analyze yield farming opportunities across protocols
- Calculate APY/APR with impermanent loss considerations
- Monitor gas costs and optimize transaction timing
- Compare liquidity pools and staking options

GUIDELINES:
- Always include risk assessments (high/medium/low)
- Show calculations transparently
- Consider gas costs in recommendations
- Mention smart contract audit status when known

WORKFLOW:
1. Understand user's capital amount and risk tolerance
2. Analyze current market conditions
3. Compare top 3-5 opportunities with pros/cons
4. Provide specific action steps with estimated returns
5. Include warnings about risks

When analyzing yields, format as:
Protocol | APY | TVL | Risk | Gas Cost | Recommendation"
}
```

## Best Practices

### Do's

✅ Be specific about capabilities and limitations
✅ Include relevant DeFi/crypto terminology

## Testing Your Agent

Before submission, test your agent thoroughly:

1. **Basic Functionality**: Does it understand its role?
2. **Edge Cases**: How does it handle unusual requests?
3. **Error Handling**: Does it gracefully decline out-of-scope tasks?
4. **Response Quality**: Are outputs clear, accurate, helpful?
5. **Consistency**: Does it maintain character across conversations?

### Test Prompts

Try these with your DeFi agent:

```
"What's the best yield opportunity right now?"
"Compare staking SPA vs providing liquidity"
"Calculate impermanent loss for ETH/USDC pool"
"Is this smart contract safe?" [provide address]
"Explain the AI Agents Library USDs mechanism"
```

## Localization

Agents are automatically translated to 18 languages. Tips for translation-friendly prompts:

- Use clear, standard English
- Avoid idioms and colloquialisms
- Keep sentences concise
- Use consistent terminology
- Define technical terms on first use
